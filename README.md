### PyBer_Analysis

## 1. Overview of the Project

The purpose of the project is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Additionally, using the generated graph, to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## 2. Results

Per the averages of the given time frames, the highest average fare per driver, per city type, in order of highest to lowest, is 1. Rural, 2. Suburban, and 3. Urban. See the below screenshot. Similarly, the average fare per ride follows the same trend, albiet not as drastic of a difference as the Average Fare per Driver (Rural's $55 per driver to Urban's $16 per driver).
