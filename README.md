### PyBer_Analysis

## 1. Overview of the Project

The purpose of the project is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Additionally, using the generated graph, to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## 2. Results

  - Initial Results

Per the averages of the given time frames, the highest average fare per driver, per city type, in order of highest to lowest, is 1. Rural, 2. Suburban, and 3. Urban. See the below screenshot. Similarly, the average fare per ride follows the same trend, albiet not as drastic of a difference as the Average Fare per Driver (Rural's $55 per driver to Urban's $16 per driver). What this leads to is the higher population density of Urban Pyber drivers, and frequency of riders leading to more overall total fares in comparison to Rurual and Suburban city types.

  - Course of Action/Recommendation

As per the above graph, and the information generated in creating the graph, there are three recommendations that can be made for addressing disparities:

    1. The substantially higher number of drivers in Urban areas greatly subsidize the rideshare's ability to compete in rural and suburban areas.
    
    2. The average ride lenght, assuming consistent rates amoung all three city types, is lower in urban areas than rurual or suburban areas. 
    
    3. Use of a fixed cost model in high density areas can bring in more rideshare market growth, while maintaining profitability.
   

## 3. Summary

Pyber's viability is highly dependent on it's urban market share. The urban rideshare service allows Pyber to compete in suburban and rural areas, yet has the lowest fare per driver and lowest fare per ride.
